* TODO Update forms to clear when something happens
* DONE Make the remove-user backend call return :message in its body
* TODO Figure out the user experience for expired tokens - this just silently and inexplicably fails now
* DONE Support the frontend to check if a token is admin too
* TODO We need to do some externs for production runs - in particular around the admin tokens, my guess is the js/sessionStorage stuff
